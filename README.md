# About the Project
This is my first advance CSS and Sass project as a part of the projects of the bestselling course “UDEMY - Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!”. With this beautiful and perfectly designed project, I have learned complex CSS animations, advanced responsive design techniques, flexbox layouts, Sass, CSS architecture, fundamental CSS concepts, and so much more.

# Technologies & Techniques Used:
• Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition

• Using Sass: global variables, architecting CSS, managing media queries, etc.

• The NPM ecosystem: development workflows and building processes

• Advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements

• Flexbox layouts

• CSS Grid layouts

• Advanced responsive design: media queries, mobile-first vs desktop-first, em vs rem units, etc.

• Responsive images in HTML and CSS for faster pageloads

• SVG images

• Build a background video effect

• Clip-path, background-clip, mask-image
